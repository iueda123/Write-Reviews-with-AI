Datasets and data acquisition
We acquired the complete set of citations retrieved from electronic search from 10 distinct SRs
spanning eight unique clinical domains through purposeful convenience sampling based on Oxford
CEBM SR question types. To compile these datasets, we engaged with systematic review investigators
at the University of Calgary and the University of Toronto. We extracted study information
concerning review objectives from the published manuscript or PROSPERO protocol, and contacted
study authors for internal reviewer inclusion/exclusion criteria. Study objectives and eligibility
criteria for each review are reported below in Supplementary Note 1.
In brief, ‘SeroTracker’ (ST) was a living SR of prevalence, exploring observational cohort studies that
reported single-estimate prevalence in the context of COVID-19.1 ‘Reinfection’ was an SR of
intervention benefits that assessed the comparative effectiveness of vaccination and past COVID-19
infection relative to past COVID-19 infection alone in observational studies reporting associations. 2
‘PA-Outcomes’ was an SR of intervention benefits comparing clinical outcomes between surgery and
medication treatments in patients with primary aldosteronism.3 ‘PA-Testing’ was an SR of diagnostic
test accuracy evaluating guideline-recommended confirmatory tests (i.e., saline infusion test, salt
loading test, fludrocortisone suppression test, and captopril challenge test) relative to a reference
standard.4 ‘Sepsis’ was an SR of intervention benefits that assessed the comparative effectiveness and
safety of fludrocortisone plus hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone alone and placebo/usual care in adults
with septic shock.5 ‘Spinal’ was an SR of diagnostic test accuracy that evaluated the efficacy of
intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring among patients undergoing spine surgery for any
indication.6 ‘Calcium-HA’ was an SR of intervention benefits that compared the outcomes of routine
calcium administration to no calcium administration for cardiac arrest in adults or children. 7 ‘InfantNO’ was an SR of prognosis that assessed whether an immediate response to inhaled nitric oxide
therapy was associated with reduced mortality in preterm infants with hypoxemic respiratory failure
and pulmonary hypertension.8 ‘Meds-HA’ was an SR of SRs, covering intervention benefits, that
identified medications that affected hospital admissions.9 ‘SVCF’ was an SR of prognosis that
evaluated the association of low SVC flow, diagnosed in the first 48 hours after birth
echocardiography, with neurological morbidity and mortality, among very preterm neonates. 10
The complete set of citations retrieved from electronic search for each review was downloaded from
Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), a systematic review screening
software. Citations were stored in csv files, containing reference information (title, authors, DOI, etc.)
and abstract content. To obtain this complete set of citations, we downloaded all ‘Included’ (included
articles after full-text screening), ‘Excluded’ (excluded articles during full-text screening), and
‘Irrelevant’ (excluded articles at abstract screening) articles from Covidence. The ’Excluded’ and
‘Irrelevant’ citations were collated to form our excluded article dataset (complete set of citations
3

excluded during review screening). Duplicate citations, and citations missing identifier (DOI) or
abstract content were discarded.
As full-text articles were not provided in Covidence, we obtained all free full-text articles with the
PMC ID Converter API to convert abstract DOIs into Pubmed IDs (PMIDs), followed by the BioC
API for PMC to obtain XML full-text files from each abstract PMID. Full-texts not available on PMC
were excluded.
The datasets described here (complete set of citations retrieved from electronic search for each
review), and all associated metadata, are available at (https://github.com/JZSang/srma). We invite
other researchers to contribute to our growing BenchSR.
Testing Methodology
To determine the minimum sensitivity (‘included’) and specificity (‘excluded’) sample size for our
evaluations during prompt development, we used the Cochran’s sample size formula. 11
For our minimum sensitivity (‘included’) sample size, we set our desired confidence level to 95%
(p=0.05), Margin of Error (MoE) to 5%, and estimated a model sensitivity of 85%. We set our model
sensitivity and specificity at 85% based on previous literature estimates.12,13 This resulted in a
minimum sensitivity sample size of 196 (included) articles.
For our minimum specificity (‘excluded’) sample size, we set our desired confidence level to 95%
(p=0.05), Margin of Error (MoE) to 5%, and estimated a model specificity of 85%. We set our model
specificity at 85% based on previous literature estimates. 12,13 This resulted in a minimum specificity
sample size of 196 (excluded) articles.
We utilized data from the SeroTracker SR (n=130k excluded abstracts, n=3000 included abstracts) to
randomly derive balanced sets of included and excluded abstracts for our train, and validation
samples (Train: n=200 included, n=200 excluded; Validation: n=200 included, n=200 excluded), in line
with our above sample size calculation. Furthermore, we randomly sampled sets of included and
excluded abstracts for our few-shot GPT-CoT prompting to prevent cross contamination (GPT-CoT:
n=100 included, n=100 excluded). The train and validation samples were used in our prompt
development cohort.
Following prompt development, we tested the performance of our optimized prompting strategy on
the ST Test sample, and 9 other SR abstract datasets to model its real-world performance and
generalizability across different SR domains. These datasets were held-out from any prompt
engineering steps and represent our testing cohort.

4

Due to the large number of citations in the ST dataset, we opted to perform a random sample of
n=10,000 articles for our abstract ST test sample. Here, we set the number of ‘included’ articles based
on the existing prevalence of ‘included’ articles in the complete set of citations (2.1%). This resulted
in 210 ‘included’ articles and 9790 ‘excluded’ articles. For the 9 other SRs, we performed entire
sampling, and included all ‘included’ and ‘excluded articles. Although we only use a subset of articles
in our ST test sample, our test sample of 10,000 exceeds the total number of citations retrieved in all 9
other SRs.
We replicated the same procedures for full-text evaluations. In brief, we randomly sampled the
SeroTracker SR (n=4737 excluded, n=1672 included PMC-scraped full-texts) to derive our training
and validation samples (Train: n=200 included, n=200 excluded; Validation: n=200 included, n=200
excluded). The SeroTracker test sample was composed of all remaining articles (Test: n=1297
included, n=4637 excluded). We did not perform few-shot experiments in our full-text evaluations
due to context length limitations.
Following our prompt-optimization procedures, we tested the performance of our ISO-ScreenPrompt
prompting strategy for full-text screening on the SeroTracker Test sample, and 9 other SR datasets.
For the 9 other SRs, we performed entire sampling, and included all ‘included’ and ‘excluded’ free
PMC full-texts.
Few-shot Prompting and Ablation Studies
Our few-shot examples were randomly sampled from the above-described GPT-CoT split. Unless
specified, our few-shot prompts used k=10 examples (5 included, 5 excluded), in agreement
with MedPrompt and general prompting guidelines. 14 We refer to this distribution of labeled
examples as ‘balanced’ as there is an equal number of included and excluded few-shot examples.
We hypothesized that we could modulate model specificity and sensitivity by adjusting the ratio of
included and excluded few-shot examples. For example, an ‘inclusion-favored’ distribution of
examples (9 included, 1 excluded) might enhance the sensitivity of the model, and vice versa. We
performed additional experiments exploring the effect of altering the distribution of our labeled fewshot examples. Here, we randomly selected 9 included and 1 excluded examples for our ‘inclusionfavored’ prompt; and 1 included and 9 excluded examples for our ‘exclusion-favored’ prompt. Results
are reported in Supplement Figure 1b and Supplement Table 4.
We also perform additional ablation experiments with our prompts, to better understand the
relative contribution of each prompt iteration in Abstract ScreenPrompt and ISO-ScreenPrompt.
For example, in Abstract ScreenPrompt, we iteratively test the effect of adding SR objectives, or
adding ‘Abstract’ screening instructions. For ISO-ScreenPrompt, we iteratively test prompt

in Supplement Figure 1a, 2a, and Supplement Table 3 and Supplement Table 8.
Time and Cost Analysis
Based on previous studies, the time required to screen a single abstract ranges from 20-461 seconds,15–
17

and 4.3-20 minutes for a single full-text article.17,18 Our literature search was as follows:

We aligned with Perlman-Arrow et al.16 due to our use of the same ST dataset and set the screening
time at 30 seconds per abstract. We took the median time of 12 minutes 9 seconds per full-text
article, based on the literature estimates retrieved from our search.
LLM API and LLM Evaluations
We used GPT3.5-Turbo-0125 (GPT3.5), GPT4-0125-preview, GPT4-Turbo-0409, GPT4o-0513,
Gemini Pro, open Mixtral-8x22-0424, Mistral-Large-0224, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022 models and
compared their performance for abstract and full-text screening with our optimized ‘Abstract
ScreenPrompt’ and ‘ISO-ScreenPrompt prompts’, respectively. For all models, we set the maximum
tokens to 2048, and used the advised default settings. GPT model settings were set to temperature=1,
top_p=1, frequency_penalty=0, presence_penalty=0. The Gemini pro model settings were set to
temperature=1, top_p=1. The Mixtral-8x22-0424, and Mistral-Large-0224 model settings were set to
temperature=0.7, top_p=1. Claude model settings were set to temperature=1, top_p=1, top_k=250. We
note that for Gemini Pro, the default temperature was changed to temperature=0.9 as of May 2024
(after our testing). We set the seed for all of our LLM models at 0.

6

The temperature and top_p ranges for all of the models used in our investigation ranges from 0-2,
with 0 being most deterministic and 2 being the most random and diverse. We chose to keep
temperature and top_p parameters at 1 for two reasons. Firstly, previous research has indicated that
model accuracy for problem-solving tasks does not significantly differ within the temperature range
of 0 to 1.19 Second, because we conducted a cross-model evaluation (i.e., comparing Gemini, GPT,
Mistral models), we used default temperature settings to avoid unnecessary variation. For instance,
the default temperature for Gemini is set to 0.9, while the default temperature for GPT is set to 1. It is
unclear whether setting the same temperature value across different models results in the same
degree of stochasticity due to potential differences in their underlying architectures and training data.
Therefore, using the default settings for each model ensured consistency and comparability in our
evaluations
To evaluate the model responses, we required an output containing an ‘evaluation token’: either
“XXX” (exclude) or “YYY” (include). When responses contained both “XXX” and “YYY”, we checked
the last 500 characters of the output and used the final instance of the token.
We conducted our initial runs synchronously, sending requests directly to the API and waiting for
responses in the same network call. This approach allowed us to easily retry individual calls to a
model’s API. For each article, if a response was interrupted by a technical error (rate limit,
disconnect, timeout) or was missing an ‘evaluation token’, we retried the instance up to three times.
If all three attempts failed, we deemed the request as ‘unparseable’ and disqualified the request from
the total count, occasionally reducing the set by 1-2 articles. During the writing of this paper,
OpenAI released the Batch API, which significantly reduced costs and improved run times. Shifting
to this infrastructure meant we could no longer efficiently retry individual abstracts, but the new
system greatly reduced technical errors and rarely resulted in missing “evaluation tokens”.

{Model output}
**Population**:
1. The study involves humans of any age. [Meets criteria]
2. The subjects include those with suspected disease without requiring them to
have been deliberately sampled for being antigen positive. [Meets criteria]
**Study Design**:
1. This is a cross-sectional serologic survey. It fits the inclusion criteria for
study design as it is one of the specified designs interested in measuring
seroprevalence. [Meets criteria]
2. Serology measurements were presumably taken at a single time point as
common in cross-sectional designs. [Meets criteria]
**Special Design**:
1. This paper is not a systematic review or meta-analysis but rather a primary
seroprevalence study. However, non-systematic reviews/meta-analyses are not
listed as exempt from consideration; the inclusion criteria express a specific
interest in systematic reviews and meta-analyses without excluding primary
studies. [Meets criteria]
**Sampling**:
1. The method of sampling is not entirely detailed in the abstract, but given
that it's a cross-sectional study among a defined number of participants (888),
it suggests a deliberate approach to sampling, which is compliant with the
inclusive approach to any sampling method. [Meets criteria]
**Types of Evidence**:
1. Assuming this is a published academic article (given its detailed results and
conclusions, along with the referencing of copyright by Wiley & Sons Ltd.), it
meets the criteria for the types of evidence being sought. [Meets criteria]
**Outcome Measures**:
1. The study reports a seroprevalence estimate, with 30% of the study
volunteers having detected neutralizing antibodies. [Meets criteria]
2. The number of participants enrolled in the study is clearly stated as 888.
[Meets criteria]
3. While the study sampling end date/week is not explicitly mentioned, this
detail might be present in the full text; however, for abstract screening, its
absence is noted but its potential availability in the full report could still mean
the study might meet the criteria upon full review. [Unclear]
4. The study clearly reports the location as being in Egypt, fitting the
requirement to categorize the location of the study. [Meets criteria]
Given that all but one of the clear inclusion criteria are met with only the
study sampling end date/week not explicitly stated in the abstract, there's a
stronger leaning towards inclusion, with the assumption that further details
necessary to fully satisfy all criteria might be found in the full text.

Let's evaluate the abstract provided against the inclusion and exclusion criteria
systematically.
### Inclusion Criteria Evaluation:
1. **Population:** The study includes humans of any age, which meets the
criterion. It doesn't specify excluding only those with suspected or confirmed

COVID-19, suggesting broader inclusion, thus meeting this requirement.
2. **Study design:** The study design focuses on the qualitative assay of
immunoglobulins G and M in diagnosed patients, aiming to assess
transmissibility and the possibility of reinfection. This can be interpreted as
part of a broader sero-survey effort, but it appears more focused on specific
diagnostic outcomes rather than prevalence estimation. It lacks a clear
mention of being a cross-sectional, repeated cross-sectional, or cohort study as
defined by our criteria.
3. **Special design:** The study does not present itself as a systematic review or
meta-analysis of seroprevalence studies.
4. **Sampling:** The method of sampling is not explicitly described, but the
study included a total of 553 patients, indicating a form of sampling was done.
5. **Types of evidence:** Presumably, this is published or unpublished
academic literature, considering it has authorship and an abstract, thus
meeting this criterion.
6. **Outcome measures:** The abstract reports on IgG and IgM levels in
patients, implying an assessment of seroprevalence to some extent. However,
it does not clearly state it reports a seroprevalence estimate in terms of the
proportion of the population with detectable antibodies. The number of
participants is reported, but it lacks clear information on study sampling end
date/week or detailed location categorization.
### Exclusion Criteria Evaluation:
1. **Population:** This study is conducted in humans, thus not meeting any of
the population-based exclusion criteria directly.
2. **Study design:** The study could arguably fall under the exclusion due to its
focus on evaluating immunological responses rather than explicitly being a
cross-sectional or cohort design aimed at seroprevalence estimation.
3. **Types of evidence:** There’s no mention of using excluded multimedia
sources or unassociated dashboards.
4. **Outcome measures:** The abstract mainly discusses the detection of IgG
and IgM antibodies but does not only report on antigen prevalence. However,
it does not fully comply with reporting requirements around the study
sampling end date/week or location detail.
### Conclusion:
Given the specific focus on evaluating immunological responses in patients
rather than estimating the seroprevalence across a population, and the absence
of clear compliance with several crucial inclusion criteria (study design
specifics, complete outcome measure reporting), the study appears to lean
more towards exclusion based on its design and reported outcomes.
However, considering the nature of abstract reviews, the decision leans on
available information which might not fully capture the study's relevance to
the systematic review aims. Given the potential relevance of immunological
response data to the broader topic of seroprevalence and immunity estimation,
there is a fine line of interpretation.
Considering the primary focus on diagnostic outcomes as opposed to
population-level antibody prevalence estimation and the critical unfulfilled
aspects of both inclusion and exclusion criteria, the conclusion leans towards:

Supplementary Note 1: SR Objectives and Eligibility Criteria
The documents below represent the identical study objectives and eligibility criteria that were
inserted in our prompts (‘simplified objectives and inclusion/exclusion criteria’). We also report the
‘Original Author Protocol’ documents that were provided by the original study authors for each SR.
SeroTracker (ST)
Simplified Objectives + Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Our systematic review is governed by the following objectives: (i) describe the global prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies based on serosurveys; (ii) detect variations in seroprevalence arising from
study design and geographic factors; (iii) identify populations at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection;
and (iv) evaluate the extent to which surveillance based on detection of acute infection
underestimates the spread of the pandemic.
The following is an excerpt of two sets of criteria. A study is considered included if it meets all the
inclusion criteria. If a study meets any of the exclusion criteria, it should be excluded. Here are the
two sets of criteria:
Inclusion Criteria (all must be fulfilled):
Population
1. Humans of any age
2. Including COVID-19 antigen positive persons and those with suspected disease if not deliberately
sampled.
Study design
1. Sero-surveys – defined as the collection and testing of serum (or proxy such as oral fluid) specimens
from a sample of a defined population over a specified period of time to estimate the prevalence of
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as an indicator of immunity
2. Cross-sectional, repeated cross sectional, and cohort study designs, with serology measurements at
single time points or repeated at multiple time points
Special design
1. Include systematic reviews and meta-analysis of seroprevalence studies for the purpose of tracking
evidence synthesis efforts
Sampling
1. Any sampling method
Types of evidence
1. Published or unpublished academic literature, grey literature (government or institutional reports),
or media reports. Slide deck presentations were included if we could identify the person giving the
presentation and the date of the presentation
Outcome measures
43

1. Reports a seroprevalence estimate (proportion of the population with detectable antibodies)
2. Reports the number of participants enrolled in the study (denominator)
3. Reports study sampling end date/week
4. Reports the locations at which the study took places such that they could be categorized as
neighbourhood, city, state/province/territory, or country
Exclusion Criteria (if any met then exclude):
Population
1. Non-human (e.g., in silico, animal, in vitro)
2. The study only included individuals with suspected, active, or previously diagnosed with COVID19 using PCR, antigen testing, clinical assessment, or self-assessment

Study design
1. Study designs other than cross-sectional or cohort design: case reports, case-control studies,
evaluations of serological tests, study protocols
Types of evidence
1. Multimedia sources of data (audio clips, video clips) were excluded due to the feasibility of
extracting. Slide deck presentations were excluded if we could not identify the person giving the
presentation and the date of the presentation
2. Dashboards not associated with a defined serology study
Outcome measures
1. Only reports incidence or prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen (as opposed to antibody)

Reinfection
Simplified Objectives + Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
We aimed to systematically review the evidence for the magnitude and duration of the effectiveness
of (i) previous infection and (ii) hybrid immunity against multiple clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2
infection caused by the omicron variant. We also aimed to examine the comparative protection of
hybrid immunity relative to previous infection only, vaccination only, and hybrid immunity with
fewer vaccine doses.
The following is an excerpt of two sets of criteria. A study is considered included if it meets all the
inclusion criteria. If a study meets any of the exclusion criteria, it should be excluded. Here are the
two sets of criteria:
Inclusion Criteria (all must be fulfilled):
Population
1. Humans of any age, in any geographical setting.
Exposure Group
1. Confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without COVID-19 vaccination.
A. SARS-CoV-2 infection will be defined as a confirmed case according to the following criteria,
adapted from WHO case definitions (positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) according to
laboratory records or self report, positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic test (AgRDT)a with
high accuracy according to laboratory records or self report, or a positive serology test from a labbased assay (i.e. CLIA/ELISA) or an antibody-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ab-RDT) with high
accuracya).
2. Studies will be included if they report on individuals with previously confirmed infection that have
documented vaccination (partially, fully, or boosted), as defined in the randomized controlled trials
for each vaccine.
A. Partial vaccination will be defined as >14 days after a single dose of Pfizer/BioNTech-Comirnaty,
<7 days from the second dose for Pfizer/BioNTech-Comirnaty (BNT162b2), >14 days after a single
dose of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria, <14 days from the second dose for AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria, >14 days
after a single dose of Moderna-mRNA-1273, <14 days from the second dose of Moderna-mRNA-1273,
<14 days from the first dose of Janssen-Ad26.COV2.S, and >14 days after a single dose of SinovacCoronaVac.
B. Full vaccination will be defined as >7 days from the second dose for Pfizer/BioNTechComirnaty, >14 days from the first dose of Janssen-Ad26.COV2.S, >14 days from the second dose for
AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria, Moderna-mRNA-1273, or Sinovac-CoronaVac.
C. Booster vaccination one will be defined as >=7 days from an additional dose after full vaccination.
D. Booster vaccination two will be defined as >=7 days from an additional dose after booster
vaccination one.
Comparison Group

1. no previous vaccinations and no previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection defined using WHO
criteria;
2. previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection defined using WHO criteria;
3. partial vaccination (defined above);
4. full vaccination (defined above);
5. booster vaccination (defined above).
Outcome
1. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection defined as a possible, probable, or confirmed reinfection case according to
the following criteria, adapted from WHO case definitions.
A. Possible reinfection case will be defined as NAAT or AgRDT SARS-CoV-2 positive case with a

includes lineage that was not submitted to SARS-Cov-2 genomic databases at the time of first
infection.
C. Confirmed reinfection case will be defined as two PCR positive episodes supported by viral
genomic data from both episodes of infection revealing different Pango lineages. If viral genomic data
reveal two distinct Pango lineages this will qualify as adequate evidence to confirm reinfection,
regardless of the time elapsed between the two episodes.

PA-Testing
Simplified Objectives + Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
The purpose of this study was to assess the characteristics of confirmatory tests for primary
aldosteronism (PA) and to interpret these in the context of study design and potential risks of bias.
The following is an excerpt of two sets of criteria. A study is considered included if it meets all the
inclusion criteria. If a study meets any of the exclusion criteria, it should be excluded. Here are the
two sets of criteria:
Inclusion Criteria (all must be fulfilled):
1. The study is about primary aldosteronism (PA). Please note that primary hyperaldosteronism is a
synonym.
2. The study examined at least one of the guideline-recommended confirmatory tests for PA. We are
interested in the saline infusion test (SIT), oral salt loading test (SLT), fludrocortisone suppression test
(FST), and the captopril challenge test (CCT). Please note some may have synonyms (e.g., SIT =
intravenous saline suppression test [IVSS]).
3. Research articles reporting original data
4. The study is conducted in humans of any age
5. The study is in the English language
6. The performance of the confirmatory test(s) was compared with an independent reference
standard A reference standard needs to be present to verify disease status. These may include: (i)
clinical response to treatment (adrenalectomy and/or medical therapy), (ii) adrenal vein sampling
results, (iii) histopathology, (iv) or another confirmatory test.
7. The confirmatory test was used to diagnose PA, rather than exclusively for subtyping. We are
interested in knowing how confirmatory testing works for diagnosing PA, not just subtyping. If the
confirmatory test was for subtyping, it is still possible to compare how many people had PA vs. nonPA.
8. The data (as published) is extractable for a 2x2 table (TP, FP, FN, TN). If the data are reported in
any of the following formats, a 2x2 table can be reconstructed:(i) 2x2 table given, (ii) TP, FP, FN, TN
rates given, (iii) Total number of patients (with disease) and total number of study subjects (with and
without disease) is known, and corresponding sensitivity and specificity are given.
Exclusion criteria (if any met then exclude):
1. No mention about primary aldosteronism (PA)
2. Use of confirmatory tests that fall outside of guide-line recommendations
3. Non-human (e.g., in silico, animal, in vitro).
4. Conference abstracts, reviews (systematic reviews and narrative reviews), editorials, protocols, and
secondary publications (data already published in another study).
5. No comparison of confirmatory test performance with a reference standard.
54

6. Confirmatory test was used only for subtyping, and unable to compare cases of PA vs. non-PA
7. Data not extractable for 2x2 table

Original author protocol
METHODS
Protocol and registration
The protocol for this review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023395927) on
02/15/2023 and modified on 03/21/2023 to include patients ≥16 years (previously ≥18
years). We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews incorporating
Network Meta-Analyses guidelines (17) to report this study.
Eligibility criteria
We included RCTs that assigned individuals aged ≥16 years with septic shock (sepsis and
use of at least one vasopressor) to receive hydrocortisone alone, hydrocortisonefludrocortisone, placebo or usual care. Placebo and usual care were considered
interchangeable in the main analysis, but lack of placebo control was considered in the risk
of bias assessment. Trials evaluating hydrocortisone as part of ascorbic acid- or thiaminebased ‘metabolic resuscitation’ (18) were excluded. We included published peer-reviewed
trials regardless of language if abstracts were reported in English. Reports in non-English
languages were translated. Studies were limited to those published starting 8/1991 when
the first consensus definition of sepsis was established by the Society for Critical Care
Medicine and American College of Chest Physicians (19).

In an effort to prevent intraoperative neurological injury during spine surgery, the use of
intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has increased significantly in recent years.
Using IONM, spinal cord function can be evaluated intraoperatively by recording signals from

(MEP), electromyography (EMG) and multimodal monitoring
Outcomes
1. True positives (a change in monitoring corresponding to a change in postoperative neurologic
status)
2. False positive (a change in monitoring corresponding to no change in postoperative neurologic
status)
3. False negative (no change in monitoring, but a change in postoperative neurologic status
4. True negative (no change in monitoring corresponding to no change in postoperative neurologic
status)

for cardiac arrest in adults or children
The following is an excerpt of two sets of criteria. A study is considered included if it meets all the
inclusion criteria. If a study meets any of the exclusion criteria, it should be excluded. Here are the
two sets of criteria:
Inclusion Criteria (all must be fulfilled):
1. Adults and children in any setting (in-hospital or out-of-hospital) with cardiac arrest
2. Reports administration of calcium (intravenous or intraosseous) during cardiac arrest as compared
to no administration of calcium during cardiac arrest. Other eligible terms for calcium include
calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, and calcium gluconate.

quality of life, survival and survival with favourable neurologic outcome to hospital discharge, 30
days or longer.
4. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (non-randomized controlled
trials, interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) with a control
group were eligible for inclusion.
Exclusion criteria (if any met then exclude):
1. No mention of cardiac arrest
2. No mention of calcium administration during cardiac arrest, or comparison between calcium
administration and no calcium administration during cardiac arrest.
4. No mention of relevant outcomes
5. Ecological studies, case series, case reports, reviews, abstracts, editorials, comments, letters to the
editor, and unpublished studies

72

Original author protocol
The study question was framed using the PICOST (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome,
Study Design, Time frame) format: in adults and children in any setting (in-hospital or out-ofhospital) with cardiac arrest (P), does administration of calcium (intravenous or intraosseous) during
cardiac arrest (I) as compared to no administration of calcium during cardiac arrest (C) improve
clinical outcomes (O).
Relevant outcomes were prioritised by the ILCOR Advanced Life Support and Paediatric Life Support
Task Forces and based on the available literature. We included return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC), health-related quality of life, survival and survival with favourable neurologic outcome to
hospital discharge, 30 days or longer.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (non-randomized controlled trials,
interrupted time series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) with a control group were
eligible for inclusion. Ecological studies, case series, case reports, reviews, abstracts, editorials,
comments, letters to the editor, and unpublished studies were excluded. All years and all languages
were included if there is an English abstract.

Infant-NO
Simplified Objectives and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted to examine
the association between immediate response (improved oxygenation ≤6 h) compared to
non-response, and all-cause mortality among preterm infants <34 weeks gestational age
without congenital anomalies or genetic disorders who received inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)
treatment.
The following is an excerpt of two sets of criteria. A study is considered included if it meets all the
inclusion criteria. If a study meets any of the exclusion criteria, it should be excluded. Here are the
two sets of criteria:
Inclusion Criteria (all must be fulfilled):

with inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) at any point during NICU or hospital admission
2. Comparative studies that divided the cohort based on iNO responsiveness, defined by an
absolute reduction in FiO2 or a synonymous measure of oxygenation within ≤6 h of
treatment initiation, were included.
3. Reported pre-discharge mortality outcomes, which was defined as death from any cause
occurring prior to hospital discharge. Additional eligible outcomes included severe
neurological injury, defined as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) ≥ grade 3 or
periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), overall and among survivors, bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD) diagnosed at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) or at hospital discharge if
<36 weeks PMA in survivors only, and neurodevelopmental impairment at a minimum of 18–
24 months post-discharge.

Meds-HA
Simplified Objectives and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
The objectives of this study were to systematically review the evidence to identify medications that
affect hospital admissions and prioritize therapies for quality improvement by assessing the quality of
evidence and cross-referencing the findings with clinical guidelines.
Inclusion Criteria (all must be fulfilled):
1. We included systematic reviews of RCTs published in English that examined the effect of any
medication on emergency hospital admissions in adults (16 years or older).
2. We included reviews that searched two or more electronic databases and assessed and reported the
quality of included studies. We defined a medication as any administered chemical or biological
product.
3. We included only reviews that reported at least one meta-analysed effect estimate for emergency
hospital admissions that was not part of a composite measure.
4. We defined an emergency hospital admission as an unanticipated admission or readmission to
hospital that occurred at short notice because of a perceived need for immediate health care. We did
not consider admission to an emergency department or an observational unit to be a hospital
admission.
Exclusion criteria (if any met then exclude):
1. We excluded studies reporting only scheduled or elective hospital admissions.
2. We excluded studies if they were not systematic reviews with meta-analysed producing pooled
estimates
3. We excluded studies if there were not systematic reviews that included randomized controlled
trials
4. We excluded superseded Cochrane reviews (Cochrane reviews that have been replaced by newer
Cochrane reviews on the same topic).
5. We excluded non-Cochrane reviews if all the randomized controlled trial data on hospital
admissions were included in a more recent systematic review of the same intervention and patients.

{ABSTRACT CONTENT}
# Instructions
We now assess whether the paper should be included in the systematic review by evaluating it
against each and every predefined inclusion and exclusion criterion. First, we will reflect on how
we will decide whether a paper should be included or excluded. Then, we will think step by step
for each criteria, giving reasons for why they are met or not met.
Studies that may not fully align with the primary focus of our inclusion criteria but provide data or
insights potentially relevant to our review deserve thoughtful consideration. Given the nature of
abstracts as concise summaries of comprehensive research, some degree of interpretation is
necessary.
Our aim should be to inclusively screen abstracts, ensuring broad coverage of pertinent studies
while filtering out those that are clearly irrelevant. We will conclude by outputting (on the very
last line) 'XXX' if the paper warrants exclusion, or 'YYY' if inclusion is advised or uncertainty
persists. We must output either 'XXX' or 'YYY'.

# Instructions
We now assess whether the paper should be included in the systematic review by rigorously
evaluating it against each and every predefined inclusion and exclusion criterion. First, we will
reflect on how we will decide whether a paper should be included or excluded. Then, we will
think step by step for each criteria, giving reasons for why they are met or not met.
We will conclude by outputting (on the very last line) 'XXX' if the paper warrants exclusion, or
'YYY' if inclusion is advised or uncertainty persists. We must output either 'XXX' or 'YYY'.
{FULL-TEXT CONTENT}
Our systematic review is governed by the following objectives: (i) describe the global prevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies based on serosurveys; (ii) detect variations in seroprevalence arising
from study design and geographic factors; (iii) identify populations at high risk for SARS-CoV-2
infection; and (iv) evaluate the extent to which surveillance based on detection of acute infection
underestimates the spread of the pandemic.
The following is an excerpt of two sets of criteria. A study is considered included if it meets all
the inclusion criteria. If a study meets any of the exclusion criteria, it should be excluded. Here
are the two sets of criteria:
Inclusion Criteria (all must be fulfilled):
1. Humans of any age
2. Including COVID-19 antigen positive persons and those with suspected disease if not
deliberately sampled.
3. Sero-surveys – defined as the collection and testing of serum (or proxy such as oral fluid)
specimens from a sample of a defined population over a specified period of time to estimate the
prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as an indicator of immunity
4. Cross-sectional, repeated cross sectional, and cohort study designs, with serology
measurements at single time points or repeated at multiple time points
5. Include systematic reviews and meta-analysis of seroprevalence studies for the purpose of
tracking evidence synthesis efforts
Sampling

Glossary
General LLM Terminology:
Classifier Model: machine learning models designed to categorize input data into predefined
classes or labels. These models work by identifying patterns and features in the input data and
mapping them to specific categories. In the context of systematic reviews, a classifier model
could be used to determine whether an article meets inclusion criteria (“include”) or should be
excluded (“exclude”), based on its abstract or full text. Classifier models are foundational in
tasks involving categorization, prioritization, and decision-making.
Large Language Model (LLM): An advanced type of artificial intelligence typically based on deep
learning architectures like transformers, trained on a massive corpora of textual data. These
models, such as GPT or similar frameworks, are designed to perform a wide range of natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, classification, and summarization.
Prompting: refers to the practice of providing structured input instructions or queries to large
language models (LLMs) to elicit specific responses.
- In zero-shot prompting, the LLM is given only the task description or a direct question
without any examples to guide its response. The model must rely entirely on its pretrained knowledge and reasoning capabilities to generate an answer.
- Few-shot prompting involves providing the LLM with a small number of examples
(typically 1-5) within the prompt to illustrate the task. These examples serve as context
for the model, helping it generate more precise or task-specific responses.
- Chain-of-thought prompting instructs LLMs to think step-by-step. In a zero-shot setting,
LLMs generate ‘unstructured freeform reasoning’, where the step by step reasoning
does not rely on rigid data structures.
Generalist foundation models: large-scale, pre-trained AI systems developed on diverse, multidomain datasets. These models, such as GPT or BERT, form the basis for a wide range of
downstream tasks without being domain-specific at their core.
Fine-tuning: the process of adapting a pre-trained machine learning model, such as a large
language model (LLM) or neural network, to perform a specific task or operate in a specialized
domain. This is achieved by training the model further on a smaller, task-specific dataset while
leveraging the foundational knowledge it acquired during pre-training. Fine-tuning allows the
model to retain general capabilities while improving performance on the target task.
BERT fine-tuning: involves adapting the pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) model for specific downstream tasks through additional
domain-specific training. Unlike training from scratch, fine-tuning leverages BERT’s robust
contextual language understanding, enabling precise performance on specialized tasks, such as
identifying relevant publications in a systematic review or classifying biomedical text.

Model Infrastructure:
Tokens: Tokens are the basic building blocks of the input and output processed by the model.
They can represent whole words, subwords, or even individual characters, depending on the
complexity of the text.
- For example, the sentence “Systematic reviews are essential” might be broken into the
tokens: ["Systematic", " reviews", " are", " essential"].
Input tokens: tokens derived from the text you provide to the model (e.g., a query or abstract for
screening). These are counted toward the token limit.
Output tokens: tokens generated by the model as a response. The combined total of input and
output tokens must stay within the maximum tokens limit.
Maximum tokens: This parameter defines the total limit for output tokens in a single API call. For
example, if the maximum tokens are set to 4096, the model can generate up to 4096 output
tokens.
Evaluation token: To evaluate the model responses, we required an output containing an ‘evaluation
token’: either “XXX” (exclude) or “YYY” (include).
Unparseable requests: For each request sent to the API, if a response was interrupted by a technical
error (rate limit, disconnect, timeout) or was missing an ‘evaluation token’, we retried the instance up
to three times. If all three attempts failed, we deemed the request as ‘unparseable’ and disqualified the
request from the total count, occasionally reducing the set by 1-2 articles. However, after shifting to
the openAI Batch API for our re-analysis greatly reduced technical errors and rarely resulted in
missing “evaluation tokens”.
Seed parameter: The seed parameter sets the initial state of the model’s random number
generator, ensuring that the same input produces identical outputs across multiple runs. This is
useful for reproducibility in academic settings, where consistent results are critical for validation
and comparisons.
API call: An API call is a request made by one software application to another through an
Application Programming Interface (API) to retrieve or send information or perform a specific
task. In our context, our prompt (containing the article of interest) is sent to an LLM API to
generate an output (decision to include or exclude).
Model settings
Temperature: Controls the randomness of the model’s output. A higher temperature allows for
more diverse and creative responses, as it increases the probability of less common words
being selected. Lower temperatures produce more focused and deterministic outputs by
prioritizing highly probable responses.

85

Top_p: also known as nucleus sampling, adjusts the diversity of the output by limiting the
selection of tokens (words or symbols) to a subset of the most likely options.
Frequency_penalty: Frequency penalty discourages the model from repeating the same tokens
too often. By applying a penalty based on how frequently a token has already been used in the
text, it encourages more varied responses.
Presence_penalty: Presence penalty modifies the model’s tendency to include specific tokens
that have already appeared in the text. Unlike frequency penalty, which focuses on repetition
count, presence penalty discourages reuse altogether, ensuring diverse content generation.
Misc
Balanced train: The training dataset used to train or fine-tune a machine learning model has an
equal or proportional representation of all relevant classes or categories. For example, the ‘ST
train sample’ had 200 ‘included’ and 200 ‘excluded’ citations.
